                        The localStorage is an object that helps to store data with no expiration date. Therefore, this
                        data will not be deleted even the browser is closed. In other words, the user can access a
                        page’s local storage without any time limit.The functionality of the sessionStorage is similar
                        to localStorage, but it stores data only for one session. Therefore, the data is deleted when
                        the user closes the browser tab. So, it helps to add data to the session storage. It is possible
                        to access it by any page from the same site opened in that window. Once the user closes the
                        window, the session is lost.

                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.Block scope is also a
                        sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
                        curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                        something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets
                        {}.
